##INTRODUCTION

This is my repository for the ICHEC(Irish Centre for High-End Computing) Git Assignments for the academic year 2024/25.

##REPOSITORY

This repository includes all the practicals from week 2 to week 9, which are also uploaded and compiled in the sciprog.

Each practical is added to a practical branch (practical02-practical09) and merged with the main branch.
README.md files have been added to all the branches with the information required.

All the codes are compiled using gcc (GNU Compiler Collection).
